# 🦖 DeepTime - Journey Through Earth's History

> *Explore 4.5 billion years of geological time at your location*

## 🌋 What is DeepTime?

DeepTime is an educational web app that lets you explore the geological history beneath your feet. Using real geological data and AI-powered narratives, discover what your location looked like millions of years ago—from dinosaur-filled Cretaceous landscapes to ice age tundra.

**Travel through time, right where you stand.** Point your phone at the ground and journey through Earth's geological layers, learning about ancient climates, prehistoric life, and the forces that shaped our planet.

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ **Location-Based Geology** - Real geological data from USGS for any location worldwide
- ⏰ **Time Travel Slider** - Scrub through millions of years of Earth's history
- 🎙️ **AI-Powered Narratives** - Rich, contextual descriptions generated by Google Gemini
- 🦕 **AR Visualization** - See prehistoric environments in augmented reality (WebXR supported devices)
- 🌍 **Global Coverage** - Explore geological history anywhere on Earth

## 🤖 Built with AI

This project was built entirely using [Kiro](https://kiro.dev), an AI-powered IDE that combines:

### Spec-Driven Development
- **3 complete specifications** defining requirements, design, and implementation
- EARS-formatted requirements with acceptance criteria
- Architecture diagrams and correctness properties
- Full requirement traceability

### AI-Assisted Development
- **Google Gemini 2.5** for dynamic content generation
- **Kiro AI** for code generation, refactoring, and testing
- Property-based testing with fast-check
- Automated documentation generation

### Modern Tooling
- Firebase MCP integration for deployment
- Playwright for E2E testing
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling and offline support
